Task2: Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression

The goal of this project is to develop a model that accurately detects fraudulent credit card transactions using logistic regression, a widely used classification algorithm. The challenge lies in addressing the significant class imbalance, as fraudulent transactions are rare compared to legitimate ones.
Logistic Regression proved to be an effective method for detecting credit card fraud, especially when combined with techniques to handle class imbalance. The model's simplicity and interpretability make it a strong candidate for real-time fraud detection systems.
